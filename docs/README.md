Collatz-sequence
================
**Collatz sequence**: Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
Repeat the process indefinitely.

[Collatz conzecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) states that
> Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values

In this repo, there are programs to generate and play with collatz sequence.
